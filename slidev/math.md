# Math in Presentations

Slidev makes it easy to include mathematical formulas.

You can add inline math, like Einstein's famous mass-energy equivalence equation, $E = mc^2$, directly within your sentences.

For more complex formulas that need their own space, you can use block formatting:

$$x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$$
