# Marp Presentation with LaTeX

## Introduction
This is a simple Marp presentation that includes LaTeX equations.

---

## Mathematical Equation

Here's a quadratic function equation:

$$f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c$$

Where:
- $a \neq 0$
- $a$, $b$, and $c$ are constants
- $x$ is the variable

---

## Another Example

The quadratic formula:

$$x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$$

---

## Conclusion

LaTeX can be used to create mathematical expressions in Marp!
